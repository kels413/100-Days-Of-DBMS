In todays lecture i learnt bout Introduction to Database Management System.

but before we delve straight into what is Database Management System (DBMS),
Side Note : please the name is so long and I am very very enthusiased bout typing
so for that reason I will be calling it DBMS right ?, Thank you, you welcome.


back to what we were discussing, so before I start DBMS, we have a few concepts to 
put into consideration, I love asking myself alot of questions before learning a concept
and but one main one is this:

1. why do i have to learn that concept ?

let me not bore you with long talk,
 Linus Trovald: "Talk is cheap show me the code"[click here](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/437173-talk-is-cheap-show-me-the-code)

1. what is Data ??
2. what is information ??
3. what is Database ??
4. what is DBMS ??
 Why should one study DBMS ??

now what is Data ?:

    data is  raw fact (unprocessed) that we have to process to get information right??

what is information ?
    Information is the outcome of a processed Data.
    
    lets's consider this Data of a student == NAME, CLASS, AGE, GRADE, AVERAGE etc ...
    
    all of this listed here are Data right ?? which is actually the Data of student right ??,
     
    at the end of the term the students result is out, we can consider that student result as 
    
    "information" right ?? cause it's what we got after working with the students DATA.

what is Database ??
    if you have ever stored you girlfriend phone Number on a piece of paper or written a love
    love letter to your girlfriend using a paper, can i shock you ??, you aware that you have just utilized the
    power of Database ??, why the example is weird lol.... buh that's the reality of Database,
    
    now let's analyse what happend there, you know you could basically walk up to her and confess
    your feelings right ??, buh you chose to write it down, what is the use case  of that ?? is so
    that she can make reference to it anytime any day in her life and remember you right ??, that is
    indeed Database, cause all of your data is stored in a paper right ??, 
      ***************************************************************************
    Database is the collection and organization of Data so that they can be easily managed,
    retrieved and updated.

    buh now it is different in the world of computer.
        computers make use harddisk and someother computer based storage devices, even cloud
        don't freak out not heavily cloud tho lol ... (more on that later),
         to store data so that you can access it anytime, anywhere, unlike your love letter that
        mere heat can make the ink to be faded out, don't mind my boring jokes bout your creativity.
        access them anytime, any day, any where, unlike the love letter that can be easily ruined by 
        a mere hot temperature.

what is Database Management System ??

    Database Management System is a collection of control routines (software packages) that manages the functiona-
    lity of our Data, basically for easy storage and retrival.

Key Features of DBMS.
    I use this acronym which is "Dami Dont Dare Dump chris".

    Every DBMS must have these key features while its more than these, buh these are the major.

    1. Data Definition: this is basically when we define the Data types, data structures and constraints of the data to be stored
    2. Data storage: the process of storing data on secondary storage, (servers) so we can easily perform operaions on the data
    3. Data Manipulation: it is the operations on data, informally add, modify, and delete (insert, querrying and updat).
    4. Data Protection: security of the data
    5. concurent access: allow multiple users or programs to access the data at simutaneously.



In today's lectures I stretched My hand to learn bout Characteristics of DBMS.

* Characteristics of DBMS.

DBMS has alot of Interesting Features which makes it more suitable than File system, and we have discussed what filesystem storage is.


but we all know that file system has so many limitations right ??, we switched to database systems to explore the benefits of it.


The Three Scheme architecture.
let's first understand some concept before we delve into the architecture

* What is a client ??

a client is a device or a software that makes request for service or resource
from another system or device called a server.

*EXAMPLE

imagine you are surfing the internet right, now the machine such as your
laptop, mobile phone is the client, while the website you want to search is hosted on
on a server.

what is a server ??
A server is a device or software that serves the clients listens for requests through a protocol
and sends a response back to the client through protocol.

now what is a client server architecture ?

the client server model is a type of model in web development where a website or
architecture is designed using the components of both client and server side, so they
can handle requests and responds interchangeably.


now lets talk bout the schemas of Dbms

we have three schemas of architecture which are

1. 1 tier architecture
2. 2 tier architecture
3. 3 tier architecture


what is 1 tier architecture ??

a 1 tier architecture or single tier or monolithic architecture is a type of architecture
where the server, client are all in one computer.

what is a 2 tier architecture ??

a 2 tier architecture is a type where we have client server architecture, that is the client
makes request through a protocol to the server and the server responds back with a response
through a protocol again. (we have like a physical server in 2 tier architecture )


what is a three tier architecture ??

a three tier architecture is a type of architecture that is consists of

1. physical tier, provides a graphical interface for the end user to interact with the server.
2. application tier which handles the business logic, helps render dynamic content
3. database tier , which helps to store and manage data.
